  "body": "## Java Parser and Abstract Syntax Tree\r\n\r\nThis package contains a Java 1.8 Parser with AST generation and visitor support.\r\n\r\nThe AST records the source code structure.\r\nYou can analyze source code for any purpose.\r\nIt is possible to change the AST nodes or create new ones to modify the source code.\r\n\r\nWhen you need not only the text from the source code but you also need type information,\r\nyou can use [the Java Symbol Solver project.](https://github.com/javaparser/javasymbolsolver)\r\n\r\n[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.javaparser/javaparser-core.svg)](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.github.javaparser%22%20AND%20a%3A%22javaparser-core%22)\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/javaparser/javaparser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/javaparser/javaparser)\r\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/javaparser/javaparser/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/javaparser/javaparser?branch=master)\r\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/javaparser/javaparser](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/javaparser/javaparser?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n*   Light weight\r\n*   Performant\r\n*   Easy to use\r\n*   Modifiable AST\r\n*   Code generation\r\n*   Support of comments\r\n\r\n## Dependency Management\r\n\r\nThe project binaries are available in Maven Central.  Just add the following to your maven configuration or tailor to your own dependency management system.\r\n\r\nSuggested version (many fixes, new features, and mostly stable API):\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>com.github.javaparser</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>javaparser-core</artifactId>\r\n    <version>3.0.0-RC.1</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent production release:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>com.github.javaparser</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>javaparser-core</artifactId>\r\n    <version>2.5.1</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How To Compile Sources\r\n\r\nIf you have checkout the project from GitHub you can build the project with maven using:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you checkout the sources and want to view the project in an IDE, it is best to first generate some of the source files; otherwise you will get many compilation complaints in the IDE. (mvn clean install already does this for you.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn javacc:javacc\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Manual\r\n\r\nExamples of how to use the library can be found on the [Manual](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/wiki/Manual) page of the wiki\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nFirst try the [wiki](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/wiki).\r\n\r\nDidn't find an answer? Try [searching for existing issues](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20)\r\n\r\nStill nothing?

The original project, now inactive, was originally hosted at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/javaparser/) and supported only parsing Java 1.5.\r\n\r\nThe project now supports parsing Java 1.8 and aims to continue support for features in future versions of the Java language.\r\n\r\n## Related projects\r\n\r\n[JavaSymbolSolver](https://github.com/javaparser/javasymbolsolver) is a project from the same committers working on JavaParser.\r\nYou can use it to calculate the type of JavaParser expressions and connecting references with their declarations. \r\n\r\nFrom JavaParser other projects have been derived:\r\n\r\n* [Walkmod](http://walkmod.com/): a tool to automatically correct violations of code conventions\r\n* [jooby spec](http://jooby.org/doc/spec): analyze and exports [jooby routes](http://jooby.org) to [raml](http://raml.org) and [Swagger](http://swagger.io)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThis project has been maintained thanks to the joint efforts of many contributors: we are extremely grateful to all of them.\r\n\r\nIn particular we are thankful to the contributions we received by the [Walkmod](http://walkmod.com/) project which permitted to finalize support for Java 8. The author granted us the permissions to release that code also under the Apache License and we have greatly appreciated that.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nJavaParser is available either under the terms of the LGPL License or the Apache License.
